# This script is intended to copy "Staged" files into the
# "Ready" directory where they'll sit until they can be
# uploaded to DPLA.
#
# Files are kept in the "Staging" area until the base
# XSLT transform results have been approved by Penelope.
# When that approval has been received, this script will
# be run.
#
# This script does not change / transform data.
#
# Input for this script is an ODN setSpec.  The script
# will look for the corresponding file in the directory
# $SLODATA_STAGING.  That ODN setSpec should be passed
# to this script as a parameter on the command line. e.g.
# 
#   queue4ingest.sh  ohmem_p12345coll6
#
# If the file is not present in the $SLODATA_STAGING
# directory, then it's likely that it wasn't copied there
# by the prior step in this process, the "staging.sh"
# script.
