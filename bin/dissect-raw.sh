########################################################################
# This script is intended to perform an initial analysis of the OAI-PMH
# data which has been harvested from an ODN contributor.
#
# The data analyzed will be the "archivized" data, which has been
# supplemented with OAI-PMH aggregation metadata.
#
# see:  https://www.openarchives.org/OAI/2.0/guidelines-provenance.htm
#
#
# Once the XML has had the supplemental aggregator metadata inserted,
# it will be ready to re-map the incoming metadata values to the
# appropriate ODN/DPLA fields.  This script's output is intended to
# assist with the analysis of the metadata and creation of the
# set-level, "base" XSLT transform
#
# The script will look for information about the target harvest site
# in a 'transform.conf' file in the current directory.  That file is 
# created by running 'gu-setup'.
# 
# Alternately, a REPOX / ODN setSpec can be passed to this script as
# a parameter on the command line and the script will query the MySQL
# database for the appropriate details.
#
# Output from this script is ........................
#
# 
#
#   $SETSPEC-raw--DPLA_PREFIX.xml:  ...........................
# 
#
# $SETSPEC is assumed to be of the REPOX-form:  "contrib_setid"
# It can be found in MySQL under "source > odnSet"
# or in transform.conf as "SETSPEC=contrib_setid"
