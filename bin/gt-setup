#!/bin/bash
#
# This script is intended to add a configuration file to the
# current working directory.
#
# The file is named "transform.conf".
#
# The "transform.conf" can be used by subsequent scripts to
# detect the set being processed, thus ensuring that the
# value doesn't need to be entered as a parameter when
# invoking those scripts on the command line.
#
# This script will over-write any existing "transform.conf"
# files that are in the current working directory.
#
# The script accepts one parameter, which is expected to be
# an "odnSet" from the "source" table of the slo_aggregator
# database.
#
# If the parameter provided does not exactly match any odnSet
# values in the database, a wildcard search is run.  Any sets
# matching that query will have their odnSet and description
# values dumped to screen.  One handy use for this is to
# search odnSet prefixes (e.g. "ohmem_") at the commandline
# to get the script to prompt you with potential options.
#
#   Usage:  gu-setup odnSet
#
